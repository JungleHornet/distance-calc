Welcome to JungleHornet's 2D distance calculator!

It currently can only calculate distance between 2 2D points, but I may add 3d or other functions in the future.

To use, follow the console intructions.
Note: In the console, it tells you to put inputs in format (x,y), but it will work without parantheses and will ignore whitespace, except between digits.

Thank you to https://regex101.com for helping me make the RegEx for this.
